                    <p class="content">The effects of time are fascinating to me. Everyone and everything is shaped by the passing of time, yet we spend our lives trying to avoid it... to escape its touch. We build new buildings, and we make renovation after renovation, but time always leaves it mark. While there is an undeniable beauty that comes from creation and restoration, there's also a quiet, eerie beauty that comes from life fading away. All of my photos are shot in black and white to emphasize a sense of timelessness, and I hope you enjoy my work.</p>
