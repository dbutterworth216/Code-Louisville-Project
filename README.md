# Code-Louisville-Project
Personal project designed to meet the requirements for Code Louisville.

In this project, I created a website for a hypothetical photographer. It's a simple three page website set in greyscale. The front page features a javascript slideshow, and the contact page has links to exterior social media profiles. 

The website is simplistic and responsive to multiple devices and screen sizes.
